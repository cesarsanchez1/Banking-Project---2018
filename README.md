# Banking-Project---2020
This is a project that interprets customer data from a text file.
1.) Data includes things such as first name, last name, unique ID, and financial information.
2.) To import text file information, a unique file path must be included by the user for their 
specific text file (my personal file path is written on line 180).
3.) This program can be easily adjusted so that the text file path is imported by a user input in the terminal.
